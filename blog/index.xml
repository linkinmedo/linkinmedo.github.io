      <description>The problem with dotfiles As a new developer you will learn that using the cli will mean that you have to deal with what&amp;rsquo;s called dotfiles which are usually used as configuration files.
The name dotfiles come from the fact that these files names start with a dot eg: .zshrc which makes them hidden by default in file explorers.
It&amp;rsquo;s simple enough at first but problems starts to rise when you are forced to use multiple devices and want to keep your dotfiles synced between them.</description>
